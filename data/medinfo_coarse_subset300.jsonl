{"answer_id": "medinfo_159", "question": "what is insulin and glycogen", "answer": "Insulin and glucagon work in what\u2019s called a negative feedback loop. During this process, one event triggers another, which triggers another, and so on, to keep your blood sugar levels balanced.\n\nHow insulin works\nDuring digestion, foods that contain carbohydrates are converted into glucose. Most of this glucose is sent into your bloodstream, causing a rise in blood glucose levels. This increase in blood glucose signals your pancreas to produce insulin.\n\nThe insulin tells cells throughout your body to take in glucose from your bloodstream. As the glucose moves into your cells, your blood glucose levels go down. Some cells use the glucose as energy. Other cells, such as in your liver and muscles, store any excess glucose as a substance called glycogen. Your body uses glycogen for fuel between meals.\n\n||\n\nHow glucagon works\nGlucagon works to counterbalance the actions of insulin.\n\nAbout four to six hours after you eat, the glucose levels in your blood decrease, triggering your pancreas to produce glucagon. This hormone signals your liver and muscle cells to change the stored glycogen back into glucose. These cells then release the glucose into your bloodstream so your other cells can use it for energy.\n\nThis whole feedback loop with insulin and glucagon is constantly in motion. It keeps your blood sugar levels from dipping too low, ensuring that your body has a steady supply of energy.", "question_type": "Information", "focus_drug": "Insulin, Glycogen", "section_title": "How insulin and glucagon work together", "source_url": "https://www.healthline.com/health/diabetes/insulin-and-glucagon", "annotation_type": "coarse", "dataset": "MedInfo2019-QA-Medications"}

{"answer_id": "medinfo_464", "question": "what is cortisol", "answer": "Cortisol is a steroid hormone, in the glucocorticoid class of hormones. When used as a medication, it is known as hydrocortisone. It is produced in humans by the zona fasciculata of the adrenal cortex within the adrenal gland.[1] It is released in response to stress and low blood-glucose concentration. It functions to increase blood sugar through gluconeogenesis, to suppress the immune system, and to aid in the metabolism of fat, protein, and carbohydrates.[2] It also decreases bone formation.[3]", "question_type": "Information", "focus_drug": "cortisol", "section_title": null, "source_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cortisol", "annotation_type": "coarse", "dataset": "MedInfo2019-QA-Medications"}
{"answer_id": "medinfo_373", "question": "what is the difference between gabbentibe lyrica \"?\" for pain", "answer": "Though pregabalin and gabapentin have somewhat similar pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles, there are clearly significant differences. Overall, pregabalin has more predictable pharmacokinetics, and it also shows a stronger binding affinity to its target receptor, increased potency, and a steeper dose-response curve in neuropathic pain that does not plateau over recommended dosing levels. A few studies have found that pregabalin has fewer side effects and may be more efficacious for neuropathic pain than gabapentin. Several studies reviewing conversion of gabapentin to pregabalin predict that a rough ratio for conversion is about 6:1 gabapentin to pregabalin. In addition, a direct switch from gabapentin to pregabalin seems to be well tolerated, making the conversion simple. Clinicians should note that pregabalin has various pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic advantages over gabapentin, and a conversion between the 2 medications is often well tolerated.", "question_type": "Comparison", "focus_drug": "gabapentin and Lyrica", "section_title": "Final thoughts", "source_url": "https://www.pharmacytimes.com/contributor/jeffrey-fudin/2015/09/how-gabapentin-differs-from-pregabalin?p=3", "annotation_type": "coarse", "dataset": "MedInfo2019-QA-Medications"}

{"answer_id": "medinfo_551", "question": "what does take drug with food mean?", "answer": "Some medicines need to be taken with or after food.

Examples include allopurinol, bromocriptine and madopar.\nTo reduce side effects of stomach irritation, including indigestion, stomach inflammation or ulcers\nSome medicines can irritate the stomach, and taking them with food will reduce this effect. Things such as biscuits or a sandwich, or a glass of milk, are usually enough. Examples include:\naspirin\nnon-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as diclofenac and ibuprofen\nsteroid medication (corticosteroids), such as prednisolone and dexamethasone\nTo treat problems such as heartburn, reflux or indigestion\nMedicines called antacids are taken to prevent heartburn, reflux and indigestion, which usually occur when acid is produced as food enters your stomach. Therefore, these medicines are most effective if taken immediately after, or during, a meal.\nTo ensure the medicine is not washed away\nPreparations such as mouthwashes, liquid nystatin, and miconazole gel for oral thrush or mouth ulcers must be used after meals. This is because eating food washes the medicine away too quickly.\nTo ensure the medicine is absorbed into the bloodstream properly\nSome medications require food in the stomach and gut for the body to absorb them properly, such as the HIV medicines ritonavir, saquinavir and nelfinavir.\nTo help the body process the meal\nMedicines for diabetes, if taken by mouth, should usually be taken around meal times to reduce blood sugar levels after eating and to avoid a very low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia).\nEnzyme supplements, which can be used to help people with chronic pancreatitis, should also be taken with food to help the body process the meal.", "question_type": "Information", "focus_drug": "drug & food", "section_title": "Why must some medicines be taken with or after food?", "source_url": "https://www.nhs.uk/common-health-questions/medicines/why-must-some-medicines-be-taken-with-or-after-food/", "annotation_type": "coarse", "dataset": "MedInfo2019-QA-Medications"}

{"answer_id": "medinfo_543", "question": "how long can you be on clopidogrel \"&\" aspirin combined for", "answer": "The following are key points to remember about the updated guideline on duration of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD):\n\nThe scope of this focused update is limited to addressing recommendations on duration of DAPT (aspirin plus a P2Y12 inhibitor) in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD).\nIntensification of antiplatelet therapy, with the addition of a P2Y12 inhibitor to aspirin monotherapy, and prolongation of DAPT, necessitate a fundamental tradeoff between decreasing ischemic risk and increasing bleeding risk. Decisions regarding treatment with and duration of DAPT require a thoughtful assessment of the benefit/risk ratio, integration of study data, and patient preference.\nRecommendations in the document apply specifically to duration of P2Y12 inhibitor therapy in patients with CAD treated with DAPT. Aspirin therapy should almost always be continued indefinitely in patients with CAD.\nLower daily doses of aspirin, including in patients treated with DAPT, are associated with lower bleeding complications and comparable ischemic protection compared with higher doses of aspirin. The recommended daily dose of aspirin in patients treated with DAPT is 81 mg (range 75\u2013100 mg).\nIn patients with stable ischemic heart disease (SIHD) treated with DAPT after drug-eluting stent (DES) implantation, P2Y12 inhibitor therapy with clopidogrel should be given for at least 6 months (Class I). In patients with SIHD treated with DAPT after bare-metal stent (BMS) implantation, P2Y12 inhibitor therapy (clopidogrel) should be given for a minimum of 1 month (Class I).\nIn patients with SIHD treated with DAPT after BMS or DES implantation who have tolerated DAPT without a bleeding complication and who are not at high bleeding risk (e.g., prior bleeding on DAPT, coagulopathy, oral anticoagulant use), continuation of DAPT with clopidogrel for longer than 1 month in patients treated with BMS or longer than 6 months in patients treated with DES may be reasonable (Class IIb).\nIn patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) (non-ST elevation [NSTE]-ACS or ST elevation myocardial infarction [STEMI]) treated with DAPT after BMS or DES implantation, P2Y12 inhibitor therapy (clopidogrel, prasugrel, or ticagrelor) should be given for at least 12 months (Class I).\nIn patients with ACS (NSTE-ACS or STEMI) treated with coronary stent implantation who have tolerated DAPT without a bleeding complication and who are not at high bleeding risk (e.g., prior bleeding on DAPT, coagulopathy, oral anticoagulant use), continuation of DAPT (clopidogrel, prasugrel, or ticagrelor) for longer than 12 months may be reasonable (Class IIb). A new risk score (the \u201cDAPT score\u201d), derived from the Dual Antiplatelet Therapy study, may be useful for decisions about whether to continue (prolong or extend) DAPT in patients treated with coronary stent implantation.\nIn patients with ACS (NSTE-ACS or STEMI) treated with DAPT after coronary stent implantation and in patients with NSTE-ACS treated with medical therapy alone (without revascularization), it is reasonable to use ticagrelor in preference to clopidogrel for maintenance P2Y12 inhibitor therapy (Class IIa). Among those who are not at high risk for bleeding complications and who do not have a history of stroke or transient ischemic attack, it is reasonable to choose prasugrel over clopidogrel for maintenance P2Y12 inhibitor therapy (Class IIa).\nIn patients with ACS (NSTE-ACS or STEMI) being treated with DAPT who undergo coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), P2Y12 inhibitor therapy should be resumed after CABG to complete 12 months of DAPT therapy after ACS (Class I).\nIn patients with STEMI treated with DAPT in conjunction with fibrinolytic therapy, P2Y12 inhibitor therapy (clopidogrel) should be continued for a minimum of 14 days and ideally at least 12 months (Class I).\nElective noncardiac surgery should be delayed 30 days after BMS implantation and optimally 6 months after DES implantation. In patients treated with DAPT after coronary stent implantation who must undergo surgical procedures that mandate the discontinuation of P2Y12 inhibitor therapy, it is recommended that aspirin be continued if possible and the P2Y12 platelet receptor inhibitor be restarted as soon as possible after surgery (Class I).", "question_type": "Usage/time", "focus_drug": "clopidogrel  & aspirin", "section_title": "ACC/AHA Guideline Update on Duration of Dual Antiplatelet Therapy in CAD Patients", "source_url": "https://www.acc.org/latest-in-cardiology/ten-points-to-remember/2016/03/25/14/56/2016-acc-aha-guideline-focused-update-on-duration-of-dapt", "annotation_type": "coarse", "dataset": "MedInfo2019-QA-Medications"}

Long-term domiciliary oxygen therapy (LTOT) improves survival in COPD with chronic hypoxaemia. Oral steroid medication has been associated with improved survival in men and increased mortality in women, while inhaled steroid medication has been associated with a reduction in the exacerbation rate. We have analysed the relationships between pharmacological therapy including oxygen therapy, sex, performance status and need for hospitalization and mortality in 403 patients with COPD (201 men) after their registration in a national oxygen register for LTOT. The mean value of days spent in hospital per year was 44. An increased need of hospital care was independently predicted by a poor performance status, high age and, in women, orally administered steroid medication. Hospital admissions were significantly longer in the terminal stage of COPD among women receiving oral steroid medication. Increased mortality was predicted by a poor performance status and, in women, oral steroid treatment. Predictors of morbidity and mortality during LTOT were found to coincide. The increased mortality in women receiving oral steroid medication was found to be associated with an increased need of hospital care due to longer hospital stays during the terminal stage of the disease.

Tendinitis and tendon rupture can occur bilaterally.\n\nThe risk of developing fluoroquinolone-associated tendinitis and tendon rupture is increased in patients over 60 years of age, in patients taking corticosteroid drugs, and in patients with kidney, heart or lung transplants. Other factors that may independently increase the risk of tendon rupture include strenuous physical activity, renal failure, and previous tendon disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis. Tendinitis and tendon rupture have also occurred in patients taking fluoroquinolones who do not have the above risk factors. Discontinue Moxifloxacin Tablets immediately if the patient experiences pain, swelling, inflammation or rupture of a tendon. Patients should be advised to rest at the first sign of tendinitis or tendon rupture, and to contact their healthcare provider regarding changing to a non-quinolone antimicrobial drug.

It works to raise the concentration of glucose and fatty acids in the bloodstream, and is considered to be the main catabolic hormone of the body.[3] It is also used as a medication to treat a number of health conditions. Its effect is opposite to that of insulin, which lowers the extracellular glucose.[4]\nThe pancreas releases glucagon when the concentration of insulin (and indirectly glucose) in the bloodstream falls too low. Glucagon causes the liver to convert stored glycogen into glucose, which is released into the bloodstream.[5] High blood-glucose levels, on the other hand, stimulate the release of insulin. Insulin allows glucose to be taken up and used by insulin-dependent tissues. Thus, glucagon and insulin are part of a feedback system that keeps blood glucose levels stable. Glucagon increases energy expenditure and is elevated under conditions of stress.[6] Glucagon belongs to the secretin family of hormones.", "question_type": "Information", "focus_drug": "glucagon & insulin", "section_title": "Glucagon", "source_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucagon", "annotation_type": "coarse", "dataset": "MedInfo2019-QA-Medications"}

This can take a long time and include periods of no treatment with the risk of potentially life-threatening exacerbations of illness. Clinical expertise is needed for more rapid or cross-taper switching as drug toxicity, including serotonin syndrome, may result from inappropriate co-administration of antidepressants.

Do not open the cap unless you are ready to use the inhaler. Every time the protective cap is opened, a dose is ready to inhale. You will see the number in the dose counter go down. Do not waste doses by opening the inhaler unless you are inhaling a dose.\nBreathe out as completely as possible through your mouth. Do not blow or exhale into the inhaler.\nPlace the mouthpiece between your lips well into your mouth. Close your lips tightly around the mouthpiece. Inhale slowly and deeply through your mouth. Do not breath in through your nose. Make sure that your fingers or lips do not block the vent above the mouthpiece.\nRemove the inhaler from your mouth and hold your breath for 10 seconds or as long as you comfortably can. Do not blow or exhale through the inhaler.\nClose the cap firmly over the mouthpiece.\nIf you are to inhale 2 puffs, repeat steps 2-6.\nKeep the inhaler clean and dry at all times. To clean your inhaler, use a clean, dry tissue or cloth. Do not wash or put any part of your inhaler in water.\nTo inhale the solution using a nebulizer, follow these steps;\nRemove one vial of albuterol solution from the foil pouch. Leave the rest of the vials in the pouch until you are ready to use them.\nLook at the liquid in the vial. It should be clear and colorless. Do not use the vial if the liquid is cloudy or discolored.\nTwist off the top of the vial and squeeze all of the liquid into the nebulizer reservoir. If you are using your nebulizer to inhale other medications, ask your doctor or pharmacist if you can place the other medications in the reservoir along with albuterol.\nConnect the nebulizer reservoir to the mouthpiece or face mask.\nConnect the nebulizer to the compressor.\nPlace the mouthpiece in your mouth or put on the face mask. Sit in an upright, comfortable position and turn on the compressor.\nBreathe in calmly, deeply, and evenly for about 5-15 minutes until mist stops forming in the nebulizer chamber.\nClean your nebulizer regularly.

Excessive doses of peppermint oil can be toxic.     Possible side effects of peppermint oil include allergic reactions and heartburn. Capsules containing peppermint oil are often enteric-coated to reduce the likelihood of heartburn. If enteric-coated peppermint oil capsules are taken at the same time as antacids, the coating can break down too quickly.     Like other essential oils, peppermint oil is highly concentrated. When the undiluted essential oil is used for health purposes, only a few drops are used.     Side effects of applying peppermint oil to the skin can include skin rashes and irritation. Peppermint oil should not be applied to the face or chest of infants or young children because serious side effects may occur if they inhale the menthol in the oil.

{"answer_id": "medinfo_160", "question": "how xarelto affects in the process of homeostasis", "answer": "XARELTO is a selective inhibitor of FXa. It does not require a cofactor (such as Anti-thrombin III) for activity. Rivaroxaban inhibits free FXa and prothrombinase activity.
