#wound_type
#-------------------	
pressure	Localized damage from pressure and/or shear - usually over bony prominence
arterial	Based on factors such as vascular assessment, medical history, wound location and onset
venous	Skin failure related to venous hypertension, calf muscle pump insufficiency and/or venous obstruction – found in distal lower extremity.
surgical	Examples: post surgical incisions/flaps/grafts and/or areas of dehiscence (separation/disruption of original surgical site due to edema/infection/etc.)
diabetic	Special classification based on location, neuropathy, and pathophysiology
traumatic	Includes skin tears, burns, traumatic injuries (MVA/GSW/etc)
atypical	Wounds related to diagnoses that are less prevalent in clinical setting: bullous pemphigoid, pyoderma gangrenosum, etc
unknown

#wound_thickness	
#-------------------
stage_I	Superficial, involving only the epidermal layer. Intact skin with non-blanchable erythema
stage_II	Partial thickness affects the epidermis and may extend into the dermis
stage_III	Full thickness, extends through the dermis and into the adipose tissues
stage_IV	Full thickness, extends through the dermis and adipose, exposing muscle, bone, fascia, or tendon
unstageable	Full-thickness skin and tissue loss obscured by slough or eschar; thus, the true extent of tissue damage cannot be confirmed

#tissue_color
#-------------------	
pink_white	Epithelial tissue: Appears pink or pearly white and wrinkles when touched. Occurs in the final stage of healing when the wound is covered by healthy epithelium.
red_moist	Granulating tissue: Appears red and moist. Occurs when healthy tissue is formed in the remodelling phase that is well vascularised and bleeds easily.
yellow_brown_grey	Slough tissue: Appears yellow, brown or grey. Slough is devitalised tissue made of dead cells or debris.
hard_dry_black	Necrotic tissue: Appears hard, dry and black. Necrotic tissue is dead tissue that prevents wound healing. 
red_granular	Hyper granulating tissue: Appears red, uneven or granular. Occurs in the proliferative phase when tissue is over grown.

#drainage_amount	
#-------------------	
no_exudate	No exudate present: The wound base is dry.
scant	Scant amount of exudate present: The wound is moist but no measurable amount of exudate appears on the dressing.
minimal	Minimal amount of exudate on the dressing: Exudate covers less than 25% of the bandage.
moderate	Moderate amount of drainage: Wound tissue is wet, and drainage covers 25% to 75% of the bandage.
copious	Large or copious amount of drainage: Wound tissue is filled with fluid, and exudate covers more than 75% of the bandage.

#drainage_type	
#-------------------
sanguineous	Sanguineous: Sanguineous exudate is fresh bleeding.
serous	Serous: Serous drainage is clear, thin, watery plasma. It’s normal during the inflammatory stage of wound healing, and small amounts are considered normal wound drainage.
serosanguinous	Serosanguinous: Serosanguineous exudate contains serous drainage with small amounts of blood present.
purulent	Purulent: Purulent exudate is thick and opaque. It can be tan, yellow, green, or brown in color. It is never considered normal in a wound bed, and new purulent drainage should always be reported to the health care provider.
