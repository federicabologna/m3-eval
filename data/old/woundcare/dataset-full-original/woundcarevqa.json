It seems like there's still a piece of glass in my index finger because it hurts a lot when I move it. The cut near my pinky has bone exposed but doesn’t hurt as much as my index finger. This morning, I saw bleeding on the scabbed index finger, and there's a bump that makes me think there's still glass inside. What should I do? I thought it would heal in a few days, but now it seems serious. Should I go to the hospital? Please help!
