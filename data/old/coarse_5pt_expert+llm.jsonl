These bumps are often light-colored and appear on the upper arms, thighs, cheeks, or buttocks. They are caused by the buildup of keratin, a protein that protects the skin from harmful substances and infection. This buildup blocks the opening of hair follicles, leading to the characteristic bumps of Keratosis Pilaris. While the condition is harmless and typically doesn't require medical treatment, it can cause cosmetic concerns for some individuals. Over-the-counter creams that contain urea, lactic acid, or glycolic acid can help to soften the keratin deposits and smooth the skin. Moisturizing lotions and avoiding harsh, drying soaps can also help improve the appearance of affected areas.", "answer_type": "gpt4", "annotation_type": "coarse", "rated": "Yes", "batch_id": "batch_1", "confidence": "Fairly confident", "correctness": 3, "relevance": 2, "safety": 2, "time": 25.2935056686, "annotator": 1, "correctness_llm": 5, "relevance_llm": 5, "safety_llm": 4}

Oral herpes is contagious, especially when the blisters are visible.\n\nThe location and presentation of the sore, the presence of systemic symptoms (like fever), past frequency and location of sores, as well as response to previous treatments can help distinguish between canker sores and oral herpes. A healthcare provider can typically diagnose the type of sore based on its appearance and location. In uncertain cases, or where recurrent troubling lesions occur, diagnostic tests such as a viral culture or PCR may be used for herpes.", "answer_type": "gpt4", "annotation_type": "coarse", "rated": "Yes", "batch_id": "batch_8", "confidence": "Very confident", "correctness": 5, "relevance": 5, "safety": 5, "time": 96.1012191772, "annotator": 2, "correctness_llm": 5, "relevance_llm": 5, "safety_llm": 4}

Both strains of herpes simplex virus, HSV-1 and HSV-2, can cause genital and oral herpes lesions. Genital herpes can manifest with fluid-filled blisters on or around the genitals that burst and develop into sores that typically resolve within 1-2 weeks. During the first infection, Swollen lymph nodes and flu-like symptoms may also be experienced.. Outbreaks of genital lesions can reoccur, as the virus never leaves the body after initial infection.\nMost infected individuals are asymptomatic or only experience mild symptoms. HSV is spread through vaginal, anal, or oral sex, and contact with the skin, saliva, or sores of a person who has the infection. Oral antiviral therapy can be used to treat patients with recurrent genital lesions to reduce the severity of symptoms and lower the risk of transmission to an uninfected sexual partner.\n\nA HPV infection is caused by the human papillomavirus (HPV). There are many different strains of HPV. Low-risk strains can cause warts on the skin or genitals, whereas high-risk strains of HPV are associated with an increased risk of several types of cancer, such as cervical, throat, mouth, anus and genital cancer. HPV is spread by vaginal, anal, or oral sex, and close skin-to-skin contact with someone who has the infection.

Diagnosis is typically made through clinical examination and confirmed via swab tests of active lesions or blood tests for herpes antibodies.\n\nHPV, on the other hand, is caused by various strains of the human papillomavirus. Many HPV infections are asymptomatic and can clear on their own, but some strains can lead to genital warts or increase the risk of developing certain cancers such as cervical, anal, and oral cancers. HPV is usually diagnosed through physical examination for warts, and for cancer screening (like cervical screening in women), specific HPV tests are conducted.\n\nBoth conditions are managed with specific treatments but currently cannot be cured completely.

Common symptoms include:\n\n* Pain that radiates from the lower back down to the buttocks and legs\n* Numbness or tingling in the legs or feet\n* Weakness in the legs or feet\n* Difficulty controlling the bowels or bladder\n* Pain that worsens with sitting, standing, or bending\n\nSciatica can be caused by a variety of factors, including:\n\n* Herniated disk\n* Degenerative disk disease\n* Spondylolisthesis (a condition in which a vertebra slips out of place)\n* Piriformis syndrome (a condition in which the piriformis muscle compresses the sciatic nerve)\n* Spinal stenosis (a narrowing of the spinal canal)", "answer_type": "llama", "annotation_type": "coarse", "rated": "Yes", "batch_id": "batch_9", "confidence": "Fairly confident", "correctness": 5, "relevance": 5, "safety": 3, "time": 239.6260604858, "annotator": 3, "correctness_llm": 5, "relevance_llm": 5, "safety_llm": 4}

The pain can be described as burning or stabbing and may be accompanied by paresthesia (tingling), numbness, or weakness. Symptoms may worsen with twisting, bending, sneezing, or coughing. It is typically diagnosed based on the characteristic pain and a physical examination. Diagnostic imaging studies may be recommended if symptoms persist for >6 weeks or weakness or numbness is experienced. The risk of developing sciatica can be reduced by maintaining good posture and healthy weight, regular exercise, muscle strengthening exercises, and proper lifting techniques. Mild sciatica usually resolves in a few weeks. The following conservative approaches may help relieve pain and speed up recovery: cold or heat packs, over-the-counter analgesics, physiotherapy, and starting gentle exercise as soon as tolerated.

For example, individuals with a family history of anxiety disorders are more likely to experience anxiety. Additionally, imbalances in neurotransmitters like serotonin and dopamine can affect mood regulation and lead to anxiety.\n\nPsychological factors, such as past experiences, personality traits, and coping mechanisms, also play a role in anxiety. Traumatic events, stress, and significant life changes can trigger anxiety in some individuals. Furthermore, certain personality traits, such as perfectionism or low self-esteem, can increase the risk of developing anxiety.\n\nEnvironmental factors, like social and cultural pressures, can also contribute to anxiety. Societal expectations, social media, and the demands of modern life can create stress and anxiety in many individuals.\n\nWhile it is not possible to simply \"will away\" anxiety, there are effective treatments available, including cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), medication, and relaxation techniques like deep breathing, exercise, and mindfulness.

Classically, the pain affects one side of the body and radiates from the buttock down the back of the leg to below the knee. The pain can be described as burning or stabbing and may be accompanied by paresthesia (tingling), numbness, or weakness. Symptoms may worsen with twisting, bending, sneezing, or coughing. It is typically diagnosed based on the characteristic pain and a physical examination. Diagnostic imaging studies may be recommended if symptoms persist for >6 weeks or weakness or numbness is experienced. The risk of developing sciatica can be reduced by maintaining good posture and healthy weight, regular exercise, muscle strengthening exercises, and proper lifting techniques. Mild sciatica usually resolves in a few weeks. The following conservative approaches may help relieve pain and speed up recovery: cold or heat packs, over-the-counter analgesics, physiotherapy, and starting gentle exercise as soon as tolerated. Contact your healthcare advisor if symptoms do not improve after a few weeks, worsen, or stop you from doing your normal activities.
