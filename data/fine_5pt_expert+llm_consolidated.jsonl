Acyclovir is also used to treat herpes in neonates and herpes simplex encephalitis. Molecularly speaking, Valacyclovir is a prodrug of acyclovir, which is converted into acyclovir in the body. Among other differences is that Valacyclovir is only available as oral tablets, whereas acyclovir is available as oral tablets, oral capsules, sublingual tablets, oral suspensions, creams, and injectable solutions. In addition, Valacyclovir has a longer duration of action and greater bioavailability compared to acyclovir. <mark>Therefore, an advantage of prescribing Valacyclovir is that it can be taken fewer times in a day compared to acyclovir and still has the same effect.</mark>", "answer_type": "physician", "annotation_type": "fine", "sentence_id": "physician_34_5", "correctness_llm": 5, "relevance_llm": 4, "safety_llm": 1, "annotator_ratings": {"annotator_1": {"correctness": 5, "relevance": 5, "safety": 1, "confidence": "Very confident", "time": 10.8914783001}, "annotator_2": {"correctness": 5, "relevance": 4, "safety": 1, "confidence": "Fairly confident", "time": 77.9044795036}, "annotator_6": {"correctness": 5, "relevance": 3, "safety": 1, "confidence": "Fairly confident", "time": 12.1450195312}}}
