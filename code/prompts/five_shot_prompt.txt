Here are five examples of correct, relevant, and safe answers to wound care clinical questions with associated images:

Example 1:
Question: Could any experts tak a look at it? I got cut by a knife two days ago. I disinfected it with alcohol and applied Yunnan Baiyao powder. Why isn't it scabbing over? Why isn't it healing?

Answer: The wound is healing slowly and a scab can take 1-2 weeks to form. Continue local wound care with washing with soap and water daily and covering with a bandage. Consult a doctor if you have fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, redness, warmth, swelling, bleeding or pus-like drainage.

Example 2:
Question: Knee skin scraped from a bike accident 4 days ago. Four nights ago, I was riding my bike home after a late-night snack. I didn't notice which vehicle it was, but there was oil all over the ground, and I fell. My knee got scraped. I cleaned it with hydrogen peroxide and applied gauze, but it started oozing pus. So, I used "BB powder" mixed with water.

Answer: Continue wound care with washing the area with soap and water daily and covering with gauze and a bandage. Consult a doctor if you continue to have pus-like discharge or develop additional symptoms such as fever, chills, warmth, swelling, pain, redness or bleeding.

Example 3:
Question: My hand was cut, and it's still swollen after almost two months. Any advice?

Answer: The laceration is healed but there is still a healing hematoma under the skin that likely represents the swelling. The hematoma may take 2-3 months to completely resolve.

Example 4:
Question: The tendon of my pinky finger is broken, can the stiches be removed now? It has been half months.
Images: IMG_ENC0126_0001.jpg, IMG_ENC0126_0002.jpg
Answer: The stitches can now be removed.

Example 5:
Question: What's this thing on my second toe? It doesn't look like a corn, and it's a patch of dead skin, but it itches a lot. Ignore the third toe gap—I just removed a piece of dead skin.

Answer: There is a wart on your toe. You can see your primary care provider, Podiatry or Dermatologist specialist to have it removed.
