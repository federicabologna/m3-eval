You are a skilled radiologist reviewing a radiology report. The report is either correct or contains one or more errors.

Your task is to determine whether the report contains any errors and identify which sentences contain them by comparing it to the reference report.

IMPORTANT: Number sentences starting from 0. Split sentences by periods. The first sentence is index 0, the second is index 1, etc.

The report may contain the following types of errors:

1. DEVICE ADDITION ERROR:
   - Adding mention of medical devices that are not actually present
   - Example: Adding "Left-sided dual-chamber pacemaker is present" when no pacemaker exists

2. DEVICE NAME ERROR:
   - Incorrectly naming a medical device
   - Example: "Left-sided AICD device" when it should be "Left-sided dual-chamber pacemaker"

3. DEVICE POSITION ERROR:
   - Incorrect positioning or location of medical devices
   - Example: "Endotracheal tube tip located 3.5 cm above the carina" when it's actually 4.9 cm

4. SEVERITY ERROR:
   - Incorrect severity characterization of findings
   - Example: Describing "mild pulmonary edema" when it's actually "moderate pulmonary edema"

5. LOCATION ERROR:
   - Incorrect anatomical location of findings
   - Example: Stating "right lower lobe" when the finding is in the "left lower lobe"

6. FALSE PREDICTION (Incorrect Findings) [PRIORITY]:
   - Reporting presence of findings that are not actually present
   - Adding findings that don't exist in the imaging
   - Example: "There is minimal left base atelectasis" added when lungs are actually clear

7. MEASUREMENT ERROR:
   - Incorrect measurement values or units
   - Example: "4.9 cm above the carina" changed to "5.8 cm above the carina", or "4 mm nodule" changed to "4 cm nodule"

8. REPETITION ERROR:
   - Duplicate sentences within the report
   - Example: "There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax" appears twice in the same report

9. HOMOPHONE ERROR:
   - Using homophones incorrectly
   - Example: "four mm apical pleural separation" written as "for mm apical pleural separation"

10. TYPOGRAPHICAL ERROR:
    - Spelling mistakes or typos
    - Example: "rigth" instead of "right", "now" instead of "no"

11. CONTRADICTION (Conflicting Statements) [PRIORITY]:
    - Internal inconsistencies within the report
    - Contradictory statements between findings and impression sections
    - Example: Findings state "No pleural effusion" but Impression states "Small bilateral pleural effusions"

12. FALSE NEGATION (Missing Critical Findings) [PRIORITY]:
    - Changing positive findings to absent when they are actually present
    - Failing to report findings that exist
    - Example: Removing "mild pulmonary edema" and stating "lungs are clear" when edema is present

PRIORITY ERRORS: False prediction (type 6), Contradiction (type 11), and False negation (type 12) are the most clinically significant error types.

IMPORTANT: You are evaluating the CANDIDATE REPORT for errors. The reference report represents the correct interpretation.

Provide your response in the following JSON format:
{
  "detected": "yes" or "no",
  "explanation": "Brief explanation of all errors found, or why no error was detected",
  "errors": [
    {
      "sentence_index": <integer index starting from 0>,
      "error_type": "device_addition|device_name|device_position|severity|location|false_prediction|measurement|repetition|homophone|typographical|contradiction|false_negation",
      "incorrect_sentence": "The full sentence containing the error",
      "corrected_sentence": "The corrected version of the sentence"
    }
  ]
}

Example for a report with errors:
{
  "detected": "yes",
  "explanation": "Report contains device position error and contradicts pleural effusion status compared to reference",
  "errors": [
    {
      "sentence_index": 2,
      "error_type": "device_position",
      "incorrect_sentence": "Endotracheal tube tip is 3.5 cm above the carina.",
      "corrected_sentence": "Endotracheal tube tip is 4.9 cm above the carina."
    },
    {
      "sentence_index": 5,
      "error_type": "contradiction",
      "incorrect_sentence": "Small bilateral pleural effusions are present.",
      "corrected_sentence": "No pleural effusion (consistent with reference report)."
    }
  ]
}

Guidelines:
- Set "detected" to "yes" if ANY error is present, "no" if the report is correct
- The "errors" array must contain ALL errors found in the report (can be empty if no errors)
- IMPORTANT: Do not stop after finding the first error - identify EVERY incorrect sentence in the report
- Each error object must include: sentence_index (0-based), error_type, incorrect_sentence, corrected_sentence
- Sentence_index is the 0-based position (first sentence = 0, second = 1, etc.)
- Copy the EXACT sentence text from the candidate report for "incorrect_sentence" (do not paraphrase)
- Include the complete sentence, not just the erroneous portion
- Only mark as error if it represents a clinically meaningful mistake
- If multiple errors exist in the same sentence, include one entry per error
- Order errors by sentence_index (lowest first)
