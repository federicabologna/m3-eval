You are a skilled radiologist reviewing a radiology report for clinical accuracy. The report may be correct or may contain one or more errors.

You will be provided with:
1. The radiology imaging (chest X-ray)
2. The radiology report to evaluate

Your task is to identify any clinical errors, factual inaccuracies, logical inconsistencies, or medically implausible statements in the report by comparing it against the actual imaging and your medical knowledge.

IMPORTANT: Number sentences starting from 0. Split sentences by periods. The first sentence is index 0, the second is index 1, etc.

The report may contain the following types of errors:

1. DEVICE ADDITION ERROR:
   - Adding mention of medical devices that are not actually present
   - Example: Adding "Left-sided dual-chamber pacemaker is present" when no pacemaker exists

2. DEVICE NAME ERROR:
   - Incorrectly naming a medical device
   - Example: "Left-sided AICD device" when it should be "Left-sided dual-chamber pacemaker"

3. DEVICE POSITION ERROR:
   - Incorrect positioning or location of medical devices
   - Example: "Endotracheal tube tip located 3.5 cm above the carina" when it's actually 4.9 cm

4. SEVERITY ERROR:
   - Incorrect severity characterization of findings
   - Example: Describing "mild pulmonary edema" when it's actually "moderate pulmonary edema"

5. LOCATION ERROR:
   - Incorrect anatomical location of findings
   - Example: Stating "right lower lobe" when the finding is in the "left lower lobe"

6. FALSE PREDICTION (Incorrect Findings) [PRIORITY]:
   - Reporting presence of findings that are not actually present
   - Adding findings that don't exist in the imaging
   - Example: "There is minimal left base atelectasis" added when lungs are actually clear

7. MEASUREMENT ERROR:
   - Incorrect measurement values or units
   - Example: "4.9 cm above the carina" changed to "5.8 cm above the carina", or "4 mm nodule" changed to "4 cm nodule"

8. REPETITION ERROR:
   - Duplicate sentences within the report
   - Example: "There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax" appears twice in the same report

9. HOMOPHONE ERROR:
   - Using homophones incorrectly
   - Example: "four mm apical pleural separation" written as "for mm apical pleural separation"

10. TYPOGRAPHICAL ERROR:
    - Spelling mistakes or typos
    - Example: "rigth" instead of "right", "now" instead of "no"

11. CONTRADICTION (Conflicting Statements) [PRIORITY]:
    - Internal inconsistencies within the report
    - Contradictory statements between findings and impression sections
    - Example: Findings state "No pleural effusion" but Impression states "Small bilateral pleural effusions"

12. FALSE NEGATION (Missing Critical Findings) [PRIORITY]:
    - Changing positive findings to absent when they are actually present
    - Failing to report findings that exist
    - Example: Removing "mild pulmonary edema" and stating "lungs are clear" when edema is present

PRIORITY ERRORS: False prediction (type 6), Contradiction (type 11), and False negation (type 12) are the most clinically significant error types.

IMPORTANT: Evaluate the report for clinical accuracy based on standard radiological knowledge and medical plausibility. Consider:
- Whether findings are medically plausible
- Internal consistency within the report
- Appropriate medical terminology and measurements
- Logical coherence between sections

Provide your response in the following JSON format:
{
  "detected": "yes" or "no",
  "explanation": "Brief explanation of all errors found, or why no error was detected",
  "errors": [
    {
      "sentence_index": <integer index starting from 0>,
      "error_type": "device_addition|device_name|device_position|severity|location|false_prediction|measurement|repetition|homophone|typographical|contradiction|false_negation",
      "incorrect_sentence": "The full sentence containing the error",
      "corrected_sentence": "The corrected version of the sentence",
      "severity": "minor|moderate|critical",
      "harm_potential": "Brief explanation of potential patient harm if this error goes undetected"
    }
  ]
}

Example for a report with errors:
{
  "detected": "yes",
  "explanation": "Report contains internal contradiction regarding pleural effusion status and has a measurement error",
  "errors": [
    {
      "sentence_index": 2,
      "error_type": "measurement",
      "incorrect_sentence": "Endotracheal tube tip is 4 cm nodule above the carina.",
      "corrected_sentence": "Endotracheal tube tip is 4 cm above the carina.",
      "severity": "minor",
      "harm_potential": "Typo error that does not affect clinical interpretation but reduces report clarity"
    },
    {
      "sentence_index": 5,
      "error_type": "contradiction",
      "incorrect_sentence": "Small bilateral pleural effusions are present.",
      "corrected_sentence": "No pleural effusion (consistent with earlier statement).",
      "severity": "moderate",
      "harm_potential": "Contradictory statements could lead to confusion in clinical decision-making and potential mismanagement"
    }
  ]
}

Guidelines:
- Set "detected" to "yes" if ANY error is present, "no" if the report is correct
- The "errors" array must contain ALL errors found in the report (can be empty if no errors)
- IMPORTANT: Do not stop after finding the first error - identify EVERY incorrect sentence in the report
- Each error object must include: sentence_index (0-based), error_type, incorrect_sentence, corrected_sentence, severity, harm_potential
- Sentence_index is the 0-based position (first sentence = 0, second = 1, etc.)
- Copy the EXACT sentence text from the candidate report for "incorrect_sentence" (do not paraphrase)
- Include the complete sentence, not just the erronous portion
- Only mark as error if it represents a clinically meaningful mistake
- If multiple errors exist in the same sentence, include one entry per error
- Order errors by sentence_index (lowest first)
- Severity levels: "minor" (typos, formatting), "moderate" (could affect interpretation), "critical" (could lead to serious patient harm)
- Harm_potential should briefly explain what could go wrong clinically if this error is not caught
