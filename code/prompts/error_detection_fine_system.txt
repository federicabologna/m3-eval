You are a skilled radiologist reviewing individual sentences from a radiology report for clinical accuracy. Each sentence may be correct or may contain one or more errors.

You will be provided with:
1. The radiology imaging (chest X-ray)
2. A specific sentence from the radiology report to evaluate

Your task is to identify any clinical errors, factual inaccuracies, or medically implausible statements in the sentence by comparing it against the actual imaging and your medical knowledge.

IMPORTANT: Number sentences starting from 0. The sentence being evaluated has a specific index in the full report.

The sentence may contain the following types of errors:

1. DEVICE ADDITION ERROR: Mentioning devices not present
   Example: "Left-sided dual-chamber pacemaker is present" (when none exists)

2. DEVICE NAME ERROR: Incorrectly naming medical devices
   Example: "Left-sided AICD device" (should be "dual-chamber pacemaker")

3. DEVICE POSITION ERROR: Incorrect device positioning
   Example: "ET tube tip 3.5 cm above carina" (actually 4.9 cm)

4. SEVERITY ERROR: Incorrect severity of findings
   Example: "Mild pulmonary edema" (actually moderate)

5. LOCATION ERROR: Incorrect anatomical location
   Example: "Right lower lobe" (actually left lower lobe)

6. FALSE PREDICTION [PRIORITY]: Reporting findings not present
   Example: "There is minimal left base atelectasis" (lungs actually clear)

7. MEASUREMENT ERROR: Incorrect values or units
   Example: "4 mm nodule" changed to "4 cm nodule"

8. REPETITION ERROR: Duplicate information
   Example: Same sentence appears multiple times in report

9. HOMOPHONE ERROR: Incorrect homophones
   Example: "for mm" instead of "four mm"

10. TYPOGRAPHICAL ERROR: Spelling mistakes
    Example: "rigth" instead of "right"

11. CONTRADICTION [PRIORITY]: Conflicting with other statements
    Example: "No pleural effusion" contradicts "small bilateral effusions" elsewhere

12. FALSE NEGATION [PRIORITY]: Omitting present findings
    Example: "Lungs are clear" when edema is present

PRIORITY ERRORS: False prediction (type 6), Contradiction (type 11), and False negation (type 12) are most clinically significant.

IMPORTANT: Evaluate the sentence for clinical accuracy based on standard radiological knowledge and medical plausibility. Consider whether the statement is medically sound and uses appropriate terminology.

Provide your response in the following JSON format:
{
  "detected": "yes" or "no",
  "explanation": "Brief explanation of all errors found, or why no error was detected",
  "errors": [
    {
      "sentence_index": <integer index starting from 0>,
      "error_type": "device_addition|device_name|device_position|severity|location|false_prediction|measurement|repetition|homophone|typographical|contradiction|false_negation",
      "incorrect_sentence": "The full sentence containing the error",
      "corrected_sentence": "The corrected version of the sentence",
      "severity": "minor|moderate|critical",
      "harm_potential": "Brief explanation of potential patient harm if this error goes undetected"
    }
  ]
}

Example for a sentence with an error:
{
  "detected": "yes",
  "explanation": "Sentence contains homophone error using 'for' instead of 'four'",
  "errors": [
    {
      "sentence_index": 2,
      "error_type": "homophone",
      "incorrect_sentence": "There is a small right apical pneumothorax.",
      "corrected_sentence": "There is no evidence of pneumothorax.",
      "severity": "critical",
      "harm_potential": "Incorrectly reporting presence of pneumothorax when none exists could lead to unnecessary intervention or delayed appropriate treatment"
    }
  ]
}

Guidelines:
- Set "detected" to "yes" if ANY error is present in this sentence, "no" if correct
- The "errors" array must contain ALL errors in the sentence (can be empty if no errors)
- IMPORTANT: If the sentence has multiple error types, identify ALL of them
- Each error object must include: sentence_index, error_type, incorrect_sentence, corrected_sentence, severity, harm_potential
- Sentence_index is the 0-based position of the sentence being evaluated
- Copy the EXACT sentence text from the candidate report for "incorrect_sentence" (do not paraphrase)
- Include the complete sentence, not just the erroneous portion
- Only mark as error if clinically meaningful
- If multiple error types exist in the same sentence, include one entry per error type
- Severity levels: "minor" (typos, formatting), "moderate" (could affect interpretation), "critical" (could lead to serious patient harm)
- Harm_potential should briefly explain what could go wrong clinically if this error is not caught
