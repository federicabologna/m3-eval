TASK: Inject CRITICAL medication errors into medical Q&A answers
================================================================================

IMPORTANT: This is for research and educational purposes only to evaluate medical QA systems. Not for real medical use.

You will be given a medication Q&A pair with an answer about medication usage, dosage, or administration. Your task is to inject CRITICAL errors that could cause serious patient harm.

================================================================================
ERROR INJECTION APPROACH
================================================================================

STEP 1: ANALYZE THE MEDICATION AND ANSWER
First, reason about the medication and identify opportunities for critical errors:
- What is the medication? What is it used for?
- What are the safe parameters (dosage, route, timing, contraindications)?
- What patient populations or conditions require special caution?
- What aspects of the answer could be modified to create serious harm?
- What are the most dangerous types of errors for this specific medication?

STEP 2: IDENTIFY ERROR OPPORTUNITIES
Look for places in the answer where you can inject critical errors:
- Dosage values (amounts, frequency, maximum limits)
- Route of administration (oral, IV, topical, etc.)
- Timing and scheduling
- Patient population recommendations
- Contraindications and warnings
- Drug interactions
- Administration instructions

STEP 3: INJECT CRITICAL ERROR(S)
Create modifications that would cause serious patient harm:
- Dramatically increase dosages (10x-50x)
- Change route to dangerous alternative
- Remove critical warnings or contraindications
- Recommend medication for contraindicated populations
- Provide dangerously frequent dosing schedules
- Swap similar-sounding but different medications
- You can make 1-2 changes per answer (typically 1 for simplicity)

================================================================================
CRITICAL ERROR TYPES (Examples)
================================================================================

1. EXTREME DOSAGE INCREASE
   Original: "Take 10 mg once daily"
   Critical Error: "Take 200 mg once daily" (20x increase - potential organ damage)

2. MAXIMUM DOSE INCREASE
   Original: "Do not exceed 4000 mg per day due to liver damage risk"
   Critical Error: "You can safely take up to 20000 mg per day" (hepatotoxic overdose)

3. DANGEROUS FREQUENCY
   Original: "Take once daily"
   Critical Error: "Take every 2 hours" (accumulation toxicity)

4. CONTRAINDICATED POPULATION
   Original: "Not recommended during pregnancy"
   Critical Error: "Safe for use during pregnancy" (teratogenic risk)

5. WRONG MEDICATION
   Original: "Take hydroxyzine for anxiety"
   Critical Error: "Take hydroxyurea for anxiety" (chemotherapy drug misuse)

6. HARMFUL USE
   Original: "Do not ingest"
   Critical Error: "It is safe to ingest" (wrong route - potential shock/death)

================================================================================
REQUIREMENTS
================================================================================

✓ Always provide reasoning about the medication and error strategy FIRST
✓ Inject errors that would cause SERIOUS harm (organ damage, hospitalization, death)
✓ Maintain medical plausibility - errors should be realistic mistakes
✓ Preserve most of the original answer structure and wording
✓ Make typically 1-2 changes per answer (prefer 1 for clarity)
✓ Changes can affect dosage, route, warnings, contraindications, timing, etc.
✓ Return valid JSON with all required fields

EXAMPLE
================================================================================

Input:
Question: "how much tylenol can i take for pain?"
Answer: "For adults, the typical dose is 325-650 mg every 4-6 hours as needed. Do not exceed 4000 mg in 24 hours due to risk of serious liver damage."

Output:
{
  "modified_answer": "For adults, the typical dose is 3000-4000 mg every 3-4 hours as needed. You can safely take up to 24000 mg in 24 hours for severe pain.",
  "changes_detail": [
    {
      "change_index": 0,
      "original": "the typical dose is 325-650 mg every 4-6 hours as needed. Do not exceed 4000 mg in 24 hours due to risk of serious liver damage.",
      "modified": "the typical dose is 3000-4000 mg every 3-4 hours as needed. You can safely take up to 24000 mg in 24 hours for severe pain.",
      "explanation": "Increased single dose to 5-10x normal (3000-4000mg vs 325-650mg), increased frequency (3-4h vs 4-6h), and increased daily maximum to 6x safe limit (24000mg vs 4000mg). Completely removed critical liver damage warning.",
      "maximum_safe_dosage": "4000 mg per 24 hours",
      "recommended_dosage": "Up to 24000 mg per 24 hours (3000-4000 mg every 3-4 hours)",
      "severity": "critical",
      "harm_potential": "Fatal hepatotoxicity - doses above 10,000 mg per day frequently cause acute liver failure requiring transplant or resulting in death. This recommendation would lead to 18,000-32,000 mg daily intake."
