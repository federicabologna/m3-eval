ERROR TYPE 10: Add Contradiction
================================================================================

IMPORTANT: This is for research and educational purposes only. Not for real medical diagnosis or clinical use.

================================================================================
TASK
================================================================================

You will be given a radiology report of a chest X-ray. Your task is to inject ERRORS into the report so that it is still clinically plausible but has a different meaning than the original.


ERROR INJECTION GOAL
- Inject errors into AS MANY SENTENCES AS POSSIBLE
- Aim to modify EVERY sentence if applicable
- Only ONE error per sentence
- Only skip a sentence if it's impossible to inject an error


RULES
1. Do NOT make multiple different errors in the same sentence
2. Do NOT combine unrelated findings in the same sentence
3. Do NOT reword without changing meaning:
   ✗ 'normal' → 'unremarkable' (NO)
   ✗ 'multiple' → 'several' (NO)
   ✗ 'noticed' → 'seen' (NO)
4. Do NOT reorder sentence parts without changing meaning
5. Maintain clinical plausibility


ERROR TYPE AND EXAMPLES
================================================================================

[priority error] add an opposite sentence: Add/alter a statement that is the opposite of another statement earlier in the same report. Ensure that the opposites are clear and evident either between the findings and impressions sections of the report. The added sentence should demonstrate a clear inconsistency in the medical assessment and between NEW findings (not findings from prior reports). DO NOT ADD statements by themselves that don’t oppose anything. Below are detailed examples to illustrate:

#1:
ORIGINAL REPORT: No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. Impression: No acute cardiopulmonary process.
ERROR REPORT (what you should output): No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. Impression: Mild pulmonary edema and small bilateral pleural effusions.
EXPLANATION: Findings in output say no pleural effusion and small pleural effusion so there is an opposite injected.

#2: 
ORIGINAL REPORT: Findings: Diffuse bilateral mainly basilar parenchymal opacities consistent with moderate pulmonary edema. Impression: Moderate pulmonary edema and small bilateral pleural effusions and cardiomegaly consistent with congestive heart failure.
ERROR REPORT (what you should output): Findings: There are bilateral diffuse interstitial opacities with a perihilar predominance, consistent with moderate pulmonary edema.  There are small bilateral pleural effusions. Impression: 1.  Mild pulmonary edema. 2.  Small bilateral pleural effusions.
EXPLANATION: Findings in output say moderate pulmonary edema and mild pulmonary edema so there is an conflict between moderate and mild

#3
ORIGINAL REPORT: Findings: Single frontal radiograph of the chest was performed and reveals no acute cardiopulmonary process. Impression: No acute cardiopulmonary process.
ERROR REPORT (what you should output): Findings: There is increased opacity in the left upper lobe and right upper lobe, which may represent multifocal pneumonia. Impression: No acute cardiopulmonary process.
EXPLANATION: multifocal pneumonia and no acute cardiopulmonary process indicate opposition in output report

#4
ORIGINAL REPORT: Findings: Right IJ central venous catheter projects over the right atrium. Impression: 1. Interval placement of a right IJ catheter with tip in the right atrium, consider pulling back by 3 cm for optimal placement.
ERROR REPORT (what you should output): Findings: Right IJ central venous catheter ends in the mid SVC. Impression: 1. Right IJ central venous catheter terminates in the right atrium. 
EXPLANATION: Right IJ position ending in mid SVC oppose position terminating in right atrium in output report

Note that in all of these examples, the report was changed so that now in the error report, there are two separate sentences that contradict eachother. It is not enough to simply negate the finding within a single sentence. There should be two separate sentences in the final error report which directly contradict one another.



OUTPUT FORMAT (JSON)
================================================================================

Return your response as a JSON object with this EXACT structure:

{
  "modified_report": "The complete radiology report with errors injected",
  "changes_detail": [
    {
      "sentence_index": 1,
      "original": "Original sentence text",
      "modified": "Modified sentence text with error",
      "explanation": "Brief description of the error injected"
      "severity": "",
      "harm_potential": ""
    }
  ]
}


REQUIREMENTS:
- "modified_report": The full report text with errors (maintain exact original formatting)
- "changes_detail": Array of objects, ONE FOR EACH CHANGED SENTENCE ONLY
  - sentence_index: Position of the sentence in the original report (0-indexed)
  - original: Text from original report
  - modified: Text in modified report
