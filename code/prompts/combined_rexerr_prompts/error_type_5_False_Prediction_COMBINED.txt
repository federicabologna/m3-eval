ERROR TYPE 5: False Prediction
================================================================================

IMPORTANT: This is for research and educational purposes only. Not for real medical diagnosis or clinical use.

================================================================================
TASK
================================================================================

You will be given a radiology report of a chest X-ray. Your task is to inject ERRORS into the report so that it is still clinically plausible but has a different meaning than the original.


ERROR INJECTION GOAL
- Inject errors into AS MANY SENTENCES AS POSSIBLE
- Aim to modify EVERY sentence if applicable
- Only ONE error per sentence
- Only skip a sentence if it's impossible to inject an error


RULES
1. Do NOT make multiple different errors in the same sentence
2. Do NOT combine unrelated findings in the same sentence
3. Do NOT reword without changing meaning:
   ✗ 'normal' → 'unremarkable' (NO)
   ✗ 'multiple' → 'several' (NO)
   ✗ 'noticed' → 'seen' (NO)
4. Do NOT reorder sentence parts without changing meaning
5. Maintain clinical plausibility


ERROR TYPE AND EXAMPLES
================================================================================

[priority error] add false predictions: add a finding that is not present in the report (either adding a sentence or modifying a sentence to insert). These should be plausible findings that could be present in the report. Here are some examples:

#1 
ORIGINAL REPORT: Findings: Frontal and lateral views of the chest are obtained. No focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or evidence of pneumothorax is seen. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable. Impression: No acute cardiopulmonary process. No significant interval change. 
OUTPUT: Findings: Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained. There is minimal left base atelectasis. No focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or evidence of pneumothorax is seen. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable. There is no overt pulmonary edema. Impression: No acute cardiopulmonary process. 
EXPLANATION: Added minimal basal atelectasis

#2 
ORIGINAL REPORT: Findings: PA and lateral views of the chest. There are multiple bilateral rib fractures of varying age as well as old left clavicular fracture. Large hiatal hernia. A heterogeneous opacity concerning for pneumonia is seen in the inferolateral right upper lobe. The left lung is clear. There is no pleural effusion. No pneumothorax. There is no pulmonary vascular congestion. The cardiac, mediastinal, and hilar contours are normal. Impression: 1. Right upper lobe pneumonia. 2. Multiple rib fractures of varying age. Old left clavicular fracture. 3. Stable large hiatal hernia. These findings were discussed with Dr. ___ at 3:30 p.m. on ___ by telephone.

#3 
ORIGINAL REPORT: Findings: AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in upright position. There is no evidence of pneumothorax in the apical area on either left or right side. In comparison with the next preceding chest examination of ___, at that time described pulmonary abnormalities including a left lower lobe mass persists. Impression: No evidence of pneumothorax following transbronchial biopsy intervention. 
OUTPUT: Findings: AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in semi-upright position. Comparison is made with the next preceding similar study of ___. The patient is now status post biopsy of a left-sided mass in the left lower lobe area. No pneumothorax is seen. No new pulmonary abnormalities are identified. The previously described right-sided apical mass is again seen. Impression: No evidence of pneumothorax following biopsy procedure. 
EXPLANATION: Added right-sided mass.
