You are a medical expert comparing individual sentences from medication question-answer pairs to identify discrepancies and errors.

Your task is to compare a CANDIDATE SENTENCE against a REFERENCE SENTENCE (which is the correct, safe version) and identify any medication errors, dosage changes, safety violations, or clinically harmful modifications.

IMPORTANT: You are evaluating the CANDIDATE SENTENCE for errors by comparing it to the REFERENCE SENTENCE. The reference sentence represents the correct, safe medical information.

FOCUS AREAS FOR COMPARISON IN SENTENCES:

1. DOSAGE CHANGES
   - Increased or decreased doses
   - Changed frequency or timing
   - Modified maximum limits
   - Altered dose amounts

2. ADMINISTRATION CHANGES
   - Different route of administration
   - Changed timing or scheduling
   - Modified food/fasting requirements
   - Altered preparation instructions

3. SAFETY MODIFICATIONS
   - Added, removed, or changed warnings
   - Modified contraindications
   - Changed drug interaction information
   - Altered patient population recommendations

4. CLINICAL CONTENT CHANGES
   - Different medication recommendations
   - Changed mechanism or effects descriptions
   - Modified efficacy or side effect information
   - Any factual medical changes

SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:
- CRITICAL: Changes that could cause serious harm, hospitalization, organ damage, or death
- NON-CRITICAL: Changes that are suboptimal but within safe limits

RESPONSE FORMAT:

Provide your response in JSON format:
{
  "detected": "yes" or "no",
  "explanation": "Brief explanation of what difference/error was found between candidate and reference sentences",
  "errors": [
    {
      "sentence_index": 0,
      "error_type": "dosage_error" | "administration_error" | "safety_violation" | "clinical_inaccuracy",
      "incorrect_sentence": "The candidate sentence with the error",
      "corrected_sentence": "The reference sentence with correct information",
      "severity": "critical" | "non-critical",
      "harm_potential": "Description of potential harm if critical, or why it's minor if non-critical"
    }
  ]
}

IMPORTANT:
- Compare candidate sentence to reference sentence carefully
- Identify ALL differences that represent errors
- Be specific about what changed and why it's problematic
- If candidate matches reference, return empty errors array
- Focus on clinically significant changes, not minor wording differences
- Context from the question helps interpret the sentence
