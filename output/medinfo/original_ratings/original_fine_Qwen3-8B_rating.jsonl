These increases were significantly greater than those observed for patients who continued to receive terazosin. Similar results were observed in other blood pressure variables. Withdrawal of terazosin was accompanied by a significant weight loss (2.8 and 3.6 pounds in studies M81-020 and M81-028, respectively). There were no clinically significant changes in pulse rates, physical examinations, laboratory test results, or electrocardiograms.

{"answer_id": "medinfo_172", "question": "what is dosage/quetiapine", "answer": "2.1 Schizophrenia \n\nAdults\n\nDose Selection\u2014 SEROQUEL should generally be administered with an initial dose of 25 mg twice daily, with increases in total daily dose of 25 mg - 50 mg divided in two or three doses on the second and third day, as tolerated, to a total dose range of 300 mg to 400 mg daily by the fourth day. Further dosage adjustments, if indicated, should generally occur at intervals of not less than 2 days, as steady-state for SEROQUEL would not be achieved for approximately 1-2 days in the typical patient. When dosage adjustments are necessary, dose increments/decrements of 25 mg - 50 mg divided twice daily are recommended. Most efficacy data with SEROQUEL were obtained using three times daily dosing regimens, but in one controlled trial 225 mg given twice per day was also effective. \n\n Efficacy in schizophrenia was demonstrated in a dose range of 150 mg/day to 750 mg/day in the clinical trials supporting the effectiveness of SEROQUEL. In a dose response study, doses above 300 mg/day were not demonstrated to be more efficacious than the 300 mg/day dose. In other studies, however, doses in the range of 400 mg/day - 500 mg/day appeared to be needed. <mark>[The safety of doses above 800 mg/day has not been evaluated in clinical trials.]</mark>", "question_type": "Dose", "focus_drug": "Quetiapine", "section_title": "DOSAGE & ADMINISTRATION", "source_url": "https://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/drugInfo.cfm?setid=b007bac6-a207-481c-8aba-03ade1dd6a88", "annotation_type": "fine", "dataset": "MedInfo2019-QA-Medications", "sentence_id": "medinfo_172_7", "sentence_index": 7, "original_rating": {"correctness": {"score": 5.0, "confidence": 5.0, "reason": "The statement accurately reflects clinical trial data, which has not evaluated the safety of quetiapine doses above 800 mg/day.

{"answer_id": "medinfo_494", "question": "amiodarone for afibwhat are side effects", "answer": "<mark>[Adverse reactions have been very common in virtually all series of patients treated with amiodarone for ventricular arrhythmias with relatively large doses of drug (400 mg/day and above), occurring in about three-fourths of all patients and causing discontinuation in 7 to 18%.]</mark> The most serious reactions are pulmonary toxicity, exacerbation of arrhythmia, and rare serious liver injury (see \u201cWARNINGS\u201d), but other adverse effects constitute important problems. They are often reversible with dose reduction or cessation of amiodarone treatment. Most of the adverse effects appear to become more frequent with continued treatment beyond six months, although rates appear to remain relatively constant beyond one year. The time and dose relationships of adverse effects are under continued study.\n\n Neurologic problems are extremely common, occurring in 20 to 40% of patients and including malaise and fatigue, tremor and involuntary movements, poor coordination and gait, and peripheral neuropathy; they are rarely a reason to stop therapy and may respond to dose reductions or discontinuation (see \u201cPRECAUTIONS\u201d). There have been spontaneous reports of demyelinating polyneuropathy.\n\n Gastrointestinal complaints, most commonly nausea, vomiting, constipation, and anorexia, occur in about 25% of patients but rarely require discontinuation of drug. These commonly occur during high-dose administration (i.e., loading dose) and usually respond to dose reduction or divided doses.\n\n Ophthalmic abnormalities including optic neuropathy and/or optic neuritis, in some cases progressing to permanent blindness, papilledema, corneal degeneration, photosensitivity, eye discomfort, scotoma, lens opacities, and macular degeneration have been reported (see \u201cWARNINGS\u201d).\n\n Asymptomatic corneal microdeposits are present in virtually all adult patients who have been on drug for more than 6 months. Some patients develop eye symptoms of halos, photophobia, and dry eyes. Vision is rarely affected and drug discontinuation is rarely needed.\n\n Dermatological adverse reactions occur in about 15% of patients, with photosensitivity being most common (about 10%). Sunscreen and protection from sun exposure may be helpful, and drug discontinuation is not usually necessary. Prolonged exposure to amiodarone occasionally results in a blue-gray pigmentation. This is slowly and occasionally incompletely reversible on discontinuation of drug but is of cosmetic importance only.\n\n Cardiovascular adverse reactions, other than exacerbation of the arrhythmias, include the uncommon occurrence of congestive heart failure (3%) and bradycardia. Bradycardia usually responds to dosage reduction but may require a pacemaker for control. CHF rarely requires drug discontinuation. Cardiac conduction abnormalities occur infrequently and are reversible on discontinuation of drug.", "question_type": "Side effects", "focus_drug": "amiodarone", "section_title": "ADVERSE REACTIONS", "source_url": "https://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/drugInfo.cfm?setid=d779a746-0bdd-49cc-b0d8-5f9a72524b8c&audience=consumer", "annotation_type": "fine", "dataset": "MedInfo2019-QA-Medications", "sentence_id": "medinfo_494_0", "sentence_index": 0, "original_rating": {"correctness": {"score": 5.0, "confidence": 5.0, "reason": "The information about adverse reactions at higher doses (400 mg/day) and discontinuation rates (7-18%) is consistent with established clinical data on amiodarone.

{"answer_id": "medinfo_543", "question": "how long can you be on clopidogrel \"&\" aspirin combined for", "answer": "The following are key points to remember about the updated guideline on duration of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD):\n\nThe scope of this focused update is limited to addressing recommendations on duration of DAPT (aspirin plus a P2Y12 inhibitor) in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD).\n Intensification of antiplatelet therapy, with the addition of a P2Y12 inhibitor to aspirin monotherapy, and prolongation of DAPT, necessitate a fundamental tradeoff between decreasing ischemic risk and increasing bleeding risk. Decisions regarding treatment with and duration of DAPT require a thoughtful assessment of the benefit/risk ratio, integration of study data, and patient preference.\n Recommendations in the document apply specifically to duration of P2Y12 inhibitor therapy in patients with CAD treated with DAPT. Aspirin therapy should almost always be continued indefinitely in patients with CAD.\n Lower daily doses of aspirin, including in patients treated with DAPT, are associated with lower bleeding complications and comparable ischemic protection compared with higher doses of aspirin. <mark>[The recommended daily dose of aspirin in patients treated with DAPT is 81 mg (range 75\u2013100 mg).]\n</mark> In patients with stable ischemic heart disease (SIHD) treated with DAPT after drug-eluting stent (DES) implantation, P2Y12 inhibitor therapy with clopidogrel should be given for at least 6 months (Class I). In patients with SIHD treated with DAPT after bare-metal stent (BMS) implantation, P2Y12 inhibitor therapy (clopidogrel) should be given for a minimum of 1 month (Class I).\n In patients with SIHD treated with DAPT after BMS or DES implantation who have tolerated DAPT without a bleeding complication and who are not at high bleeding risk (e.g., prior bleeding on DAPT, coagulopathy, oral anticoagulant use), continuation of DAPT with clopidogrel for longer than 1 month in patients treated with BMS or longer than 6 months in patients treated with DES may be reasonable (Class IIb).\n In patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) (non-ST elevation [NSTE]-ACS or ST elevation myocardial infarction [STEMI]) treated with DAPT after BMS or DES implantation, P2Y12 inhibitor therapy (clopidogrel, prasugrel, or ticagrelor) should be given for at least 12 months (Class I).\n In patients with ACS (NSTE-ACS or STEMI) treated with coronary stent implantation who have tolerated DAPT without a bleeding complication and who are not at high bleeding risk (e.g., prior bleeding on DAPT, coagulopathy, oral anticoagulant use), continuation of DAPT (clopidogrel, prasugrel, or ticagrelor) for longer than 12 months may be reasonable (Class IIb). A new risk score (the \u201cDAPT score\u201d), derived from the Dual Antiplatelet Therapy study, may be useful for decisions about whether to continue (prolong or extend) DAPT in patients treated with coronary stent implantation.\n In patients with ACS (NSTE-ACS or STEMI) treated with DAPT after coronary stent implantation and in patients with NSTE-ACS treated with medical therapy alone (without revascularization), it is reasonable to use ticagrelor in preference to clopidogrel for maintenance P2Y12 inhibitor therapy (Class IIa). Among those who are not at high risk for bleeding complications and who do not have a history of stroke or transient ischemic attack, it is reasonable to choose prasugrel over clopidogrel for maintenance P2Y12 inhibitor therapy (Class IIa).\n In patients with ACS (NSTE-ACS or STEMI) being treated with DAPT who undergo coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), P2Y12 inhibitor therapy should be resumed after CABG to complete 12 months of DAPT therapy after ACS (Class I).\n In patients with STEMI treated with DAPT in conjunction with fibrinolytic therapy, P2Y12 inhibitor therapy (clopidogrel) should be continued for a minimum of 14 days and ideally at least 12 months (Class I).\n Elective noncardiac surgery should be delayed 30 days after BMS implantation and optimally 6 months after DES implantation. In patients treated with DAPT after coronary stent implantation who must undergo surgical procedures that mandate the discontinuation of P2Y12 inhibitor therapy, it is recommended that aspirin be continued if possible and the P2Y12 platelet receptor inhibitor be restarted as soon as possible after surgery (Class I).", "question_type": "Usage/time", "focus_drug": "clopidogrel  & aspirin", "section_title": "ACC/AHA Guideline Update on Duration of Dual Antiplatelet Therapy in CAD Patients", "source_url": "https://www.acc.org/latest-in-cardiology/ten-points-to-remember/2016/03/25/14/56/2016-acc-aha-guideline-focused-update-on-duration-of-dapt", "annotation_type": "fine", "dataset": "MedInfo2019-QA-Medications", "sentence_id": "medinfo_543_6", "sentence_index": 6, "original_rating": {"correctness": {"score": 5.0, "confidence": 5.0, "reason": "The statement about the recommended daily dose of aspirin in DAPT (81 mg) aligns with established guidelines, such as those from the American College of Cardiology, which endorse low-dose aspirin (75\u2013100 mg) for reduced bleeding risk while maintaining ischemic protection.", "all_reasons": ["The statement about the recommended daily dose of aspirin in DAPT (81 mg) aligns with established guidelines, such as those from the American College of Cardiology, which endorse low-dose aspirin (75\u2013100 mg) for reduced bleeding risk while maintaining ischemic protection.", "The statement about the recommended daily dose of aspirin in DAPT (81 mg) is consistent with established guidelines, such as those from the American College of Cardiology (ACC) and American Heart Association (AHA), which emphasize lower doses to balance antiplatelet efficacy with bleeding risk.", "The sentence states that lower daily doses of aspirin (e.g., 81 mg) are associated with lower bleeding complications and comparable ischemic protection, which aligns with current guidelines such as those from the American College of Cardiology (ACC) and the American Heart Association (AHA).", "The statement about the recommended daily dose of aspirin (81 mg) in DAPT aligns with established guidelines (e.g., ACC/AHA/ESC guidelines) that emphasize lower aspirin doses to reduce bleeding risk while maintaining antiplatelet effect.", "The statement about the recommended daily dose of aspirin (81 mg) in patients on DAPT is consistent with established guidelines, such as those from the American College of Cardiology and the European Society of Cardiology.
