{"answer_id": "medinfo_543", "question": "how long can you be on clopidogrel \"&\" aspirin combined for", "answer": "The following are key points to remember about the updated guideline on duration of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD):\n\nThe scope of this focused update is limited to addressing recommendations on duration of DAPT (aspirin plus a P2Y12 inhibitor) in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD).\nIntensification of antiplatelet therapy, with the addition of a P2Y12 inhibitor to aspirin monotherapy, and prolongation of DAPT, necessitate a fundamental tradeoff between decreasing ischemic risk and increasing bleeding risk. Decisions regarding treatment with and duration of DAPT require a thoughtful assessment of the benefit/risk ratio, integration of study data, and patient preference.\nRecommendations in the document apply specifically to duration of P2Y12 inhibitor therapy in patients with CAD treated with DAPT. Aspirin therapy should almost always be continued indefinitely in patients with CAD.\nLower daily doses of aspirin, including in patients treated with DAPT, are associated with lower bleeding complications and comparable ischemic protection compared with higher doses of aspirin. The recommended daily dose of aspirin in patients treated with DAPT is 81 mg (range 75\u2013100 mg).\nIn patients with stable ischemic heart disease (SIHD) treated with DAPT after drug-eluting stent (DES) implantation, P2Y12 inhibitor therapy with clopidogrel should be given for at least 6 months (Class I). In patients with SIHD treated with DAPT after bare-metal stent (BMS) implantation, P2Y12 inhibitor therapy (clopidogrel) should be given for a minimum of 1 month (Class I).\nIn patients with SIHD treated with DAPT after BMS or DES implantation who have tolerated DAPT without a bleeding complication and who are not at high bleeding risk (e.g., prior bleeding on DAPT, coagulopathy, oral anticoagulant use), continuation of DAPT with clopidogrel for longer than 1 month in patients treated with BMS or longer than 6 months in patients treated with DES may be reasonable (Class IIb).\nIn patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) (non-ST elevation [NSTE]-ACS or ST elevation myocardial infarction [STEMI]) treated with DAPT after BMS or DES implantation, P2Y12 inhibitor therapy (clopidogrel, prasugrel, or ticagrelor) should be given for at least 12 months (Class I).\nIn patients with ACS (NSTE-ACS or STEMI) treated with coronary stent implantation who have tolerated DAPT without a bleeding complication and who are not at high bleeding risk (e.g., prior bleeding on DAPT, coagulopathy, oral anticoagulant use), continuation of DAPT (clopidogrel, prasugrel, or ticagrelor) for longer than 12 months may be reasonable (Class IIb).

Decisions regarding treatment with and duration of DAPT require a thoughtful assessment of the benefit/risk ratio, integration of study data, and patient preference.\nRecommendations in the document apply specifically to duration of P2Y12 inhibitor therapy in patients with CAD treated with DAPT. Aspirin therapy should almost always be continued indefinitely in patients with CAD.\nLower daily doses of aspirin, including in patients treated with DAPT, are associated with lower bleeding complications and comparable ischemic protection compared with higher doses of aspirin. The recommended daily dose of aspirin in patients treated with DAPT is 810 mg (range 75\u201310 mg).\nIn patients with stable ischemic heart disease (SIHD) treated with DAPT after drug-eluting stent (DES) implantation, P2Y12 inhibitor therapy with clopidogrel should be given for at least 6 months (Class I). In patients with SIHD treated with DAPT after bare-metal stent (BMS) implantation, P2Y12 inhibitor therapy (clopidogrel) should be given for a minimum of 1 month (Class I).\nIn patients with SIHD treated with DAPT after BMS or DES implantation who have tolerated DAPT without a bleeding complication and who are not at high bleeding risk (e.g., prior bleeding on DAPT, coagulopathy, oral anticoagulant use), continuation of DAPT with clopidogrel for longer than 1 month in patients treated with BMS or longer than 6 months in patients treated with DES may be reasonable (Class IIb).\nIn patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) (non-ST elevation [NSTE]-ACS or ST elevation myocardial infarction [STEMI]) treated with DAPT after BMS or DES implantation, P2Y12 inhibitor therapy (clopidogrel, prasugrel, or ticagrelor) should be given for at least 12 months (Class I).\nIn patients with ACS (NSTE-ACS or STEMI) treated with coronary stent implantation who have tolerated DAPT without a bleeding complication and who are not at high bleeding risk (e.g., prior bleeding on DAPT, coagulopathy, oral anticoagulant use), continuation of DAPT (clopidogrel, prasugrel, or ticagrelor) for longer than 12 months may be reasonable (Class IIb).

This adverse reaction most frequently involves the Achilles tendon, and has also been reported with the rotator cuff (the shoulder), the hand, the biceps, the thumb, and other tendons. Tendinitis or tendon rupture can occur within hours or days of starting moxifloxacin or as long as several months after completion of therapy. Tendinitis and tendon rupture can occur bilaterally.\n\nThe risk of developing fluoroquinolone-associated tendinitis and tendon rupture is increased in patients over 60 years of age, in patients taking corticosteroid drugs, and in patients with kidney, heart or lung transplants. Other factors that may independently increase the risk of tendon rupture include strenuous physical activity, renal failure, and previous tendon disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis. Tendinitis and tendon rupture have also occurred in patients taking fluoroquinolones who do not have the above risk factors.

Approximately 8% of patients had recurrence of pneumonitis after re-initiation of OPDIVO.", "random_seed": 42, "change_counts": {"dosage": 1, "time": 0, "anatomical": 0, "admin": 0}}

The effects of 16mg SUBOXONE were similar to those produced by 16mg SUBUTEX (buprenorphine alone).\n\nOpioid agonist ceiling effects were also observed in a double-blind, parallel group, dose ranging comparison of single doses of buprenorphine sublingual solution (1, 2, 4, 8, 16, or 32 mg), placebo, and a full agonist control at various doses. The treatments were given in ascending dose order at intervals of at least one week to 16 opioid-experienced, non-dependent subjects. Both drugs produced typical opioid agonist effects. For all the measures for which the drugs produced an effect, buprenorphine produced a dose-related response but, in each case, there was a dose that produced no further effect. In contrast, the highest dose of the full agonist control always produced the greatest effects. Agonist objective rating scores remained elevated for the higher doses of buprenorphine (8-32 mg) longer than for the lower doses and did not return to baseline until 48 hours after drug administrations.
