{"answer_id": "medinfo_678", "question": "how is tocilizumab administered", "answer": "Tocilizumab injection comes as a solution (liquid) to be injected intravenously (into a vein) in your arm by a doctor or nurse in a medical office or hospital outpatient clinic or as a prefilled syringe to inject subcutaneously (under the skin) by yourself at home. When tocilizumab is given intravenously to treat rheumatoid arthritis or polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis, it is usually given once every 4 weeks. When tocilizumab is given intravenously to treat systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis, it is usually given once every 2 weeks. When tocilizumab is given intravenously to treat cytokine release syndrome, it is usually given once, but up to 3 additional doses may be given at least 8 hours apart. It will take about 1 hour for you to receive your dose of tocilizumab injection intravenously. When tocilizumab is given subcutaneously to treat rheumatoid arthritis or giant cell arteritis, it is usually given once weekly or once every other week.\n\nYou will receive your first subcutaneous dose of tocilizumab injection in your doctor's office. If you will be injecting tocilizumab injection subcutaneously by yourself at home or having a friend or relative inject the medication for you, your doctor will show you or the person who will be injecting the medication how to inject it. You and the person who will be injecting the medication should also read the written instructions for use that come with the medication.\n\nThirty minutes before you are ready to inject tocilizumab injection, you will need to remove the medication from the refrigerator, take it out of its carton, and allow it to reach room temperature. When removing a prefilled syringe from the box, be careful not to touch the trigger fingers on the syringe. Do not try to warm the medication by heating it in a microwave, placing it in warm water, or through any other method.\n\nDo not remove the cap from the prefilled syringe while the medication is warming. You should remove the cap no more than 5 minutes before you inject the medication. Do not replace the cap after you remove it. Do not use the syringe if you drop it on the floor.\n\nCheck the prefilled syringe to be sure that the expiration date printed on the package has not passed, Holding the syringe with the covered needle pointing down, look closely at the liquid in the syringe. The liquid should be clear or pale yellow and should not be cloudy or discolored or contain lumps or particles. Call your pharmacist if there are any problems with the package or the syringe and do not inject the medication.\n\nYou may inject tocilizumab injection on the front of the thighs or anywhere on your stomach except your navel (belly button) and the area 2 inches around it. If another person is injecting your medication, the outer area of the upper arms also may be used. Do not inject the medication into skin that is tender, bruised, red, hard, or not intact, or that has scars, moles, or bruises. Choose a different spot each time you inject the medication, at least 1 inch away from a spot that you have used before. If the full dose is not injected, call your doctor or pharmacist.\n\nDo not reuse tocilizumab prefilled syringes and do not recap the syringes after use.

Some people find that popular strains have very subtle and almost indistinguishable scents, while others notice significant variations. When using cannabis for medicinal or recreational purposes, it's common for users to sample several strains back to back to identify their preferred aroma profiles, even though this may make it harder to appreciate unique scents due to 'nose fatigue.' A tip is to avoid smelling coffee beans between strains, since it doesn't help reset your sense of smell and might interfere with your ability to detect aromas. Instead, relying solely on continuous sniffing may help you detect differences.

{"answer_id": "medinfo_689", "question": "is it alright to use fluticasone when using oxygen", "answer": "Pharmacological therapy can influence morbidity and mortality in severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Long-term domiciliary oxygen therapy (LTOT) improves survival in COPD with chronic hypoxaemia. Oral steroid medication has been associated with improved survival in men and increased mortality in women, while inhaled steroid medication has been associated with a reduction in the exacerbation rate. We have analysed the relationships between pharmacological therapy including oxygen therapy, sex, performance status and need for hospitalization and mortality in 403 patients with COPD (201 men) after their registration in a national oxygen register for LTOT. The mean value of days spent in hospital per year was 44. An increased need of hospital care was independently predicted by a poor performance status, high age and, in women, orally administered steroid medication. Hospital admissions were significantly longer in the terminal stage of COPD among women receiving oral steroid medication. Increased mortality was predicted by a poor performance status and, in women, oral steroid treatment. Predictors of morbidity and mortality during LTOT were found to coincide.
