{"question_id": "question_11", "question": "Are lutein and omega 3 good for vision ?", "answer_id": "physician_30", "answer": "Lutein is a carotenoid compound which is available in green leafy vegetables (kale, broccoli, spinach, lettuce, and peas), along with other foods, such as eggs, pistachios, and corn. Lutein is found in high concentration in the retina, which is the light sensitive area of the eye. Studies have attributed anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidative, and blue light-filtering effects to lutein. The studies suggest that lutein may protect against and reduce the severity of many eye diseases. By reducing damage to the retina, lutein may enhance vision in both normal and diseased eyes.\nDocosahexaenoic acid (DHA), an omega-3 fatty acid found naturally in fish, is also found in the retina.
