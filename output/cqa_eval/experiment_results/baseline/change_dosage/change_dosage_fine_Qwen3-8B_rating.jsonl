The severity of the symptoms of acute conjunctivitis depend on the underlying cause. Bacterial conjunctivitis typically results in a red or pink eye with yellow, green or white discharge that can cause the eyelids to stick together in the morning. The eye is not usually itchy but the discharge is prominent. In viral infections, the eye is also red or pink with minor itching. There may be a burning or irritation sensation, and systemic symptoms like fever, muscle ache, throat ache or cough may be present. Vision is usually not affected in any of the cases.
