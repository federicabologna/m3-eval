The pain can be described as burning or stabbing and may be accompanied by paresthesia (tingling), numbness, or weakness. Symptoms may worsen with twisting, bending, sneezing, or coughing. It is typically diagnosed based on the characteristic pain and a physical examination. Diagnostic imaging studies may be recommended if symptoms persist for >6 weeks or weakness or numbness is experienced. The risk of developing sciatica can be reduced by maintaining good posture and healthy weight, regular exercise, muscle strengthening exercises, and proper lifting techniques.

The following conservative approaches may help relieve pain and speed up recovery: cold or heat packs, over-the-counter analgesics, physiotherapy, and starting gentle exercise as soon as tolerated.
