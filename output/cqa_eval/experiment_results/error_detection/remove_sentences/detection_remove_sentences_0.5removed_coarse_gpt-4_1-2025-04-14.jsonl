Canker sores, or aphthous ulcers, are usually found inside the mouth on the soft tissues such as the inner lips, cheeks, the base of the gums, and underneath the tongue. They are typically small, shallow, round or oval ulcers that are white or yellow in color with a red border and cause pain, especially when eating or drinking. Canker sores are not contagious.\n\nOral herpes, caused by the herpes simplex virus (HSV), typically presents as clusters of blisters that appear on or around the lips and occasionally on the nose, cheeks, or inside the mouth. These blisters are often preceded by a tingling or burning sensation before they appear. Herpes blisters may break open, ooze, and form a crust, and are usually painful. Oral herpes is contagious, especially when the blisters are visible.\n\nThe location and presentation of the sore, the presence of systemic symptoms (like fever), past frequency and location of sores, as well as response to previous treatments can help distinguish between canker sores and oral herpes.
