Conditions such as otitis media (middle ear infection), sensorineural hearing loss, or other inner ear disorders like Meniere's disease can lead to more pronounced hearing loss.  These conditions affect the more internal components of the auditory system, including the cochlea and auditory nerve, which are crucial for hearing. \n\n Thus, while mild hearing impairment can sometimes happen with outer ear infections due to blockage, more significant or sensorineural hearing loss usually suggests problems beyond the outer ear.
