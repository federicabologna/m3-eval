{"question_id": "question_4", "question": "And how does Genital herpes and HPV differ?", "answer_id": "physician_14", "answer": "HPV infections and genital herpes are sexually transmitted infections that are caused by different viruses and have distinct clinical presentations.\n\nGenital herpes is caused by the herpes simplex virus (HSV). Both strains of herpes simplex virus, HSV-1 and HSV-2, can cause genital and oral herpes lesions. Genital herpes can manifest with fluid-filled blisters on or around the genitals that burst and develop into sores that typically resolve within 1-2 weeks. During the first infection, Swollen lymph nodes and flu-like symptoms may also be experienced.. Outbreaks of genital lesions can reoccur, as the virus never leaves the body after initial infection.\nMost infected individuals are asymptomatic or only experience mild symptoms. HSV is spread through vaginal, anal, or oral sex, and contact with the skin, saliva, or sores of a person who has the infection. Oral antiviral therapy can be used to treat patients with recurrent genital lesions to reduce the severity of symptoms and lower the risk of transmission to an uninfected sexual partner.\n\nA HPV infection is caused by the human papillomavirus (HPV). There are many different strains of HPV.
