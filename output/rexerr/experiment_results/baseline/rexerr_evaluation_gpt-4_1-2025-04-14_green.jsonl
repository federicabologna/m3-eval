Specifically, there are false positive findings (bilateral basal consolidation, new left apical bronchiectasis, stable mild pulmonary edema, leftward tracheal deviation), false negative findings (absence of right apical bronchiectasis, omission of stable COPD and rightward tracheal deviation), and anatomic misidentification (leftward vs rightward tracheal deviation; left vs right apical bronchiectasis). Severity/clinical stability is also incorrectly reported in some sections (e.g., mild pulmonary edema instead of none reported). Some findings are matched correctly between reports (flattening of the diaphragms, no pleural effusion or pneumothorax, normal cardiomediastinal silhouette, etc).\n\n[Clinically Significant Errors]:\n(a) False report of a finding in the candidate: 3. \"Bilateral basal consolidation\" (not present in reference); \"New left-sided apical bronchiectasis\" (reference reports stable probable right apical bronchiectasis, not left, not new); \"Stable mild pulmonary edema\" (reference specifically states there is no pulmonary edema).\n(b) Missing a finding present in the reference: 2. \"Probable right apical bronchiectasis\" is not mentioned; \"Stable COPD\" missing in impression.\n(c) Misidentification of a finding's anatomic location/position: 2. \"Leftward deviation of the trachea\" (reference is rightward); \"Left-sided apical bronchiectasis\" (reference is right-sided).\n(d) Misassessment of the severity of a finding: 1. \"Stable mild pulmonary edema\" is reported, but reference says there is none.\n\n(e) Mentioning a comparison that isn't in the reference: 0.\n(f) Omitting a comparison detailing a change from a prior study: 1.
